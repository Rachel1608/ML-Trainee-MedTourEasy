# ML-Trainee-MedTourEasy
As a ML Trainee, I trained in Machine Learning Specialization and worked on a Project "Sign language Recognition", The project deals with American Sign Language dataset.
The Dataset loaded into training set and testing set, Visualise the image dataset of particular classes such as A,B,C. Explored the dataset by the count of number of each class present in the data. Then did one hot Encoding to convert the categorical class to Numerical for to train the model. The model trained using Alexnet architecture with Softmax activation function, then the model is compiled with rmsprop optimizer, Categorical cross entropy loss since it is multiclass and with accuracy metrics. Model performed well with 20% validation data of accuracy 80% without getting overfitted. Lastly the MisClassified images were predicted.
